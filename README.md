# Lexer Project

Having a list of DFAs which defines the Lexem's tokens, we need to separate a given pattern into DFAs tokens.
If the pattern can be splitted into tokens, it means that the pattern is acceptable by DFAs.

# Input

Given an pattern and DFAs algorithm find the longest tokens accepted by DFAs and prints them.

# Output

<dfa_name> <accepted_symbols>

# Example
